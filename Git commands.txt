It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and public email address before doing any operation.
The easiest way to do so is:
git init: You’ve now initialized the working directory—​you may notice a new directory created, named ".git"
git clone: Clone a repository into a new directory(could be a link).


You have to identify yourself:
locally:
git config user.name "name":    This signs your name locally to current repository with name.
git config user.email "e-mail": this signs your email locally to current repository with e-mail.
globally:
git config --global user.name "name":    This signs your name globally to current repository with name.
git config --global user.email "e-mail": this signs your email globally to current repository with e-mail.

Adding files to the repo:
git add . or git add file_name: This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which Git calls the "index".
git commit file_name: This permanently stores the contents of the index in the repository.
git commit -a: This  will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add them to the index, and commit, all in one step.

Check changes:
git log: Show commit logs.
git log --graph: shows the commit logs in tree-view.
git log -n 1: shows only the most recent log.
git log -p: complete diffs at each step.
git log --stat --summary: the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step.
git diff: Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
git diff first_id second_id: changes between first and second ids.
git diff --cached: You can see what is about to be committed using git diff with the --cached option.
git status: Show the working tree status

Branching:
git branch: shows the available branches and identify the current branch with '*'.
git branch branch_name: creates new branch with branch_name.
git branch -d branch_name: deletes branch_name
git checkout branch_name: switch to the branch_name branch.

Merging:
git merge first_branch second_branch: merges two branches together


Collaboration:
git remote: to view and create remotes
git remote add referal_name link: To add a repository on GitHub as a remote.
git remote -v: v stands for verbose that means that git will get more information.
git push referal_name branch_name: to send my changes to the remote
git pull referal_name branch_name: to pull branch_name locally
bash file_name.sh remote_repo_link: pushes modified code to your fork on GitHub.
git fetch referral_name: gets a sneek peak of the log of the remotely repo.
git merge branch_name referal_name/branch_name: merges the commits on the local with remote repos.
