Q1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it might get conflict while working on a common file and the update discards
all unsaved progess.

Q2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A2. Forks: a feature in GitHub which takes a clone of another one's repository
and add it at my account.
Clones: takes a copy remotely to a local side and it can be local to local.
Branches: It is not related to them I guess, it creates a new edition or a separated
version than the original one which can be worked on separately.
