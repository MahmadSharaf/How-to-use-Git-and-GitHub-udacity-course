Q1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A1.Because it might get conflict while working on a common file and the update discards
all unsaved progress.

Q2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A2. Forks: a feature in GitHub which takes a clone of another one's repository
and add it at my account.
Clones: takes a copy remotely to a local side and it can be local to local.
Branches: It is not related to them I guess, it creates a new edition or a separated
version than the original one which can be worked on separately.

Q3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A3. It avoids unexpected conflicts and spares time of figuring out what to remove and what to keep.

Q4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
A4. It could be manually, or through a cloud service(Drive, Dropbox, Box, ..).
But obviously git and GitHub would be easier as it specialized in committing,
review, and comparing the codes or even txt.
